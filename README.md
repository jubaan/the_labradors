# The Labradors - Challenge Memory Book

This repo is to keep track of the weekly challenges solved by _*The Labradors Team*_. And to leave a trace of improvement in our coding skills.

The objective, besides solviving the challenge or generating working code, is to
understand what and how the code works so we can improve our logic and coding
skills with ruby and programming overall.

Every time a challenge is solved and presented, we benchmark and profile the
code to have a better understanding of what the code does and how it solves the
problem; giving us an overview of the bottlenecks, the time consuming methods
and letting us know, other points of view and  more approaches for solving the same issue.

## How we do it

The excercise dinamic is as follow:

- Every monday of the week a random member of the team propose a coding challenge for everyone to solve during the week.
- On friday, everyone presented their solution and the logic behind it.
- We benchmark the code against each other and observe time lapsed, used memory
    and iterations per second.
- We profile each code to see the steps it takes and where are the most
    consuming methods.
- We analize individualy each code for coding smells.
- We suggest for each solution the improvements based on our previous knowledge
    and the observations from the benchmark and ruby syntax rules.
- Everyone corrects their code individualy and presents their code improved.
